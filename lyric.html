            Many days tinted in fairy tale scenes
            Have arrived at the end, proof we have seen
            I cut out and choose from a trip so long
            A little passage I review

            Tale of what's taken place right on this field
            Shadows of manifested pain and woe
            There was a hero who took out all foes
            A little journey memory with you

            No more pages left in that story
            Our hero goes into slumber, deep
            Leaving behind a veil of peace for all
            Saving the dwellers of this land

            The flow of time erases without mercy
            And erodes all memories and hues
            Even the traces left in life are now rusting as time ensues

            And yet, I keep all your hopes
            All the words and wishes, courage you owned
            Still dwell inside me, and even now in my heart
            Keep living through

            Odyssey we shared, on the same path and nothing more to that
            So it should have been, but suddenly I was wondering
            All those tears rolling down my cheeks, why do they come out and fall?
            I wanna find out and still even right now
            If I engage in the journey we went about again
            Though I am no longer walking next to you
            One day, I know I'll find the truth

            And we begin, right to the story
            Out to meet people in this journey
            So hurry up, our chase will go on forever
            Ever, ever, ask for how long

            And now that story unfolds into
            A journey that, alone, I set out to
            I meet the locals of every town I stop in
            They all are recalling the person that you were

            Unwavering kindness is spoken of you
            Acting all cool in everything you'd do
            Here and there, we can find scattered symbols around
            Manifesting battle we won for peace

            And even that was left for me so one day
            I wouldn't find myself alone, becoming lonely
            And I call to mind every moment of our journey
            When I see the signs left in these scenes

            Ah, ah, ayy, ya
            Ah, ah, ooh, ah
            Ah, ah, ayy, ya, ayy, ayy, ya

            Many days tinted in fairy tale scenes
            Have arrived at the end, proof we have seen
            It was that moment, our fateful meeting
            One percent of the journey, spent with me

            Even if your courage is swept away to the distance
            And the wind has taken what everybody can recall
            I will bring you on with me into the future's light
            I've taken your hand in mine

            I know it all began right at that time
            Mundane everyday signs
            The moments ignited in laughter with you remain
            My reflections of those times go on as brightly shining scenes
            I wanna find out, and still even right now
            Looking back, it's you, standing and so proud
            Evermore gently smiling right at me, without a sound
            I'm perceiving you around

            And we begin, right to the story
            Out to meet people in this journey
            So hurry up, our chase will go on forever
            Ever, ever, ask for how long

            Now a new beginning has begun to be and
            In this land that you protected and kept in safety
            These budding lives are with me on this journey
